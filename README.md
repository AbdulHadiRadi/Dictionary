# Dictionary
A simple dictionary without using java built-in classes



In this mini-project I had to create a small dictionary in Dictionary class and build a class which implements an interface called WordStore. This interface defines a collection which stores Strings. It has methods:

public void add(String word) 
Adds a String to the collection 
public int count(String word) 
Returns the number of times a String is in the collection 
public void remove(String word) 
Removes one occurrence of a String from the collection, or leaves the collection unchanged if the String does not occur in it.
